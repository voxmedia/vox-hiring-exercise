## Front-end exercise

Given the Data in this folder, write html, css and javascript to present the
information specifically for mobile web browsers.

### Whats in here?

Given in this repo is a JSON file with content, a basic ERB template file and
a basic ruby build script.

To build the final output from these ingredients, from the commandline run:

```
$ ruby build.rb
```

and a file `index.html` will be produced.

### Requirements

*You must:*

- Display and style all the content in the `slides.json` file
- Display the content in order
- Each entry in the data is displayed one at a time, as a "slide" or "card"
- The user will swipe from one entry to the next
- Make it work in the mobile browser of your choice
- Have a consistent design
- Provide all the code you used to create your final product, including
instructions on how to view the final output, if necessary
- Be prepared to present and explain your work and decisions
- Submit your solution as a zip file or something via email

*Do not:*

- Take longer than 2-3 hours to make it work
- Fork this repo
- Publish your solution in a public place

*You can, if you wish:*

- Ask questions about any aspect of this code or requirements
- Change the build script and templates
- Use different tools than the included ruby build script and template (be mindful of your time)
- Use other people's code (as long as licenses allow it!)
- Structure files however you like

*Do not worry about:*

- Adhering to Vox style in fonts, colors, typography
- Making it work for large screens/desktop browsers, or other browsers/devices
- Changing the build process or using more sophisticated tools
